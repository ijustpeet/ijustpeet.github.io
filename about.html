        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p>This is my first project. It has been almost a year since I started programming and I understand how valuable the internet is for learning. So I decided to find some of the great resources and put them together here. I was genuinely inspired by the generosity and community spirit within programming. Learning about things like open source and the Unix and open-source wars opened my eyes to how remarkable this field is. It's truly respectable for people to share their hard work for others to use and build upon—something you don’t see much in other industries.</p>
        <p>It's definitely not the money hungry, tech startup image I had before. I want to continue this culture, especially for anyone not pursuing a computer science degree. I think it's agreed upon by the tech community that you don't need a degree to be a good programmer, there's just too many great resources out there and in here!</p>
        <p>If this project helps you, even a little, I consider it a success.</p>
